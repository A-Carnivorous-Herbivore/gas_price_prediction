Problem Statement:
“As of Summer of 2022, a major issue facing the common American is the price of gasoline. Prices have been trending upward for a while, but will this trend continue? Is it possible to predict the price of gasoline in the near future, perhaps as soon as next week? This would be useful to the common citizen looking to budget their gasoline usage, and reserve money for future purchases accordingly. This might also be useful for policy makers looking to tackle the rising prices.”

This project aims to predict the percent change of gasoline prices (Per Gallon, USD) in the near future through a deep learning approach. By using a Recurrent Neural Network, we will be able to explore, if any, the self-exciting nature of gasoline prices (does the price of gasoline depend on its own prior price or other historical factors?) and leverage historical economic and climate patterns to forecast future prices. These include the weekly prices of gasoline, the net weekly imports and exports of many different types of crude oil and petroleum products, and climate data such as temperature, precipitation, and etc.
